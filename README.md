# DashConCat
## A Terminal application to quickly concatinate dashcam footage

### Requirements:
- Linux
- FFMPEG
- Cyclic Recordings

### How to use:
- Run the app in your terminal `./dashConCat`. The compiled app is in the "output" folder, or alternatively you can compile from source.
- Drag & Drop the folder containing only the video files that you want to concatenate into your terminal, or enter the path manually.

- If there are no errors, FFMPEG Should start running and complete.

### ***Disclaimer:
I am still learning and I am by no means an experienced programmer, please use with caution and at your own risk. 

### To-do:
I still need to add error handling, multiple file types support, better choice of output file naming and so on and so forth.
